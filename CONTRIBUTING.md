# Contributing

We welcome external contributions to this project. For ideas for new functionality, we recommend first opening an issue so we can discuss whether it makes sense for the project.

## Contribution process

1. Open a pull request. If possible, please include thorough tests of the new code.
2. If you have not already signed a contributor agreement, we will request that you sign one. We use Adobe Sign for this so it's very quick and easy. Note that we cannot look at your pull request until a contributor agreement is signed.
3. We will then review your pull request and possibly ask for changes.
